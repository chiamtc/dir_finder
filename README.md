# dir_finder
## Motivation
- Matches regex pattern in a directory or file name because Mac search is not up on par with Windows search

**So far run time is O(n)**

## Roadmap
- [x] cross-env this repo
- [x] Testing - 100%
- [x] Testing coverage with Istanbul report
- [x] set a config file so that user doesn't need to keep setting `path` and `regex`
- different mode (strict, loose)
- [x] ~~Take args as param~~ Take args using CLI
- [x] Make it as CLI
- Summary details in CLI
- Open Summary in html and link of each source file
